Notes:

Linq Operators execution behaviour:

What are defferd operators or Lazy Operators and what are immediate operators or greddy operators when to use each other?

So Defferd Operators or Lazy Operators

The select, where, take skip etc.... this kind of operators will be considers like Defferd Operators
Coz at the time of execution it will load the data and execute the condtion when we itterate it.


For Immediate or Greddy Operators :

The Tolist(), count, average, min, max etc....... this kind of operators will be considers like Immediate or Greddy operators,
Coz at run time or time of execution it will execute the condtion immediatly and will give the results
